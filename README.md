## Task

As an employee with access to sensitive data. I want to randomly generate a password that meets certain critetia that will create a strong password that provides greater security.

This task requires oneto modify starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that they’ve selected. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It will have a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.

The password can include special characters. If you’re unfamiliar with these, see this [list of password special characters](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_special_characters) from the OWASP Foundation

## Criteria

I need a new, secure password which when I click the button to generate a password,I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria. When prompted for password criteria then I select which criteria to include in the password. When prompted for the length of the password,then I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters.When asked for character types to include in the password, then I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters. When I answer each prompt, then my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected. When all prompts are answered, then a password is generated that matches the selected criteria. When the password is generated, then the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page.
